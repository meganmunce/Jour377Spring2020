# Jour377Spring2020

My final project work for Journalism 377: Data Analysis and Visualization.

All of the data I used for this project is compiled in the Excel and CSV files in the Data folder. To get this data, I downloaded DW-NOMINATE scores from voteview.com, 
Trump agreement percentages from FiveThirtyEight.com, and compiled the data on 2018 election results and margins myself from Axios's election result map. 

All of my exact sources are linked at the bottom of the SourcesandNotebook.pdf file, where I explained my analysis process and interpretations of the data.

The AreVotersPayingAttention?.pdf file is the final story I turned in using this data.

Thank you for visiting!
